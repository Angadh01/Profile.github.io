My name is Angadh Bazaad and I am 21-year-old student living in Sydney, Australia. I was born in Sydney and grew up in the countryside of NSW on farm. I am Bilingual and able to speak Hindi, Urdu, and English being from Indian background. I have completed year 12 - HSC and have been working part time in family-owned business. During my free time I was involved in team sports, video games, working out and trying new foods. As any normal kids, I also enjoy include watching tv series on Netflix and playing mobile games, specifically clash of clans which is a team-oriented game. I love animals and have a few pets of my own which include 2 dogs and a parrot. Other hobbies of mine. 

# Interest in IT #

Growing up I have always been intrigued by console games, computers, tv’s and how they worked. My first real encounter with IT was when I was about 15, I had gotten my first Xbox and the game “Call of Duty” with it. This game was multiplayer as well as solo. I am normally a very social person so team games and games with friends are my favorite where collaboration and constant communication is required to achieve common goals. Naturally as I grew older and my interests kept changing, I had dabbled in Html coding in high school which was very intriguing to me. However, my IT journey stopped there for a while. I then started playing various team sports such as cricket, basketball, and soccer. All these sports gave me experience of how to be a functional and productive member of a team. 

Growing up I saw the evolution of technology and gaming take place in front of me, things like games graphics were becoming more aesthetic, devices like phones having facial recognition, apps being developed for food tracking. I knew right away it was something I wanted to be a part of. I always enjoyed working in teams and knew in the future I would be doing something that requires various teamwork/management skills.  IT has such a vast range of fields and is such an ever-growing industry, I believe jobs in IT will only grow as more things start to move online like we have seen over time. This made IT appeal to me because it is a safe career path and will never be irrelevant. IT is so broad which is perfect for me to find what working environment/field I will enjoy and thrive in the most.

To start my IT journey, I had to get some sort of foundation in IT as well as knowledge and experience. This is when I decided to pick RMIT as my college to pursue my studies and complete my bachelor's degree in. RMIT Online offered the perfect schedule and flexibility I wanted for studying this personally made it super appealing to me. In my studies I expect to learn about all major concepts of IT and computing as well as deep knowledge in a certain field I like. In IT and STEM – related job roles. The most coveted skills in the industry right now include coding, computation, data processing, network information security, algorithm design, web design/architecture, storage systems and management and mobile development. I hope to learn all these skills to open various avenues of employment opportunities. IT is a very wide field and has many components to it, though I have no previous background in IT I am excited to see which area of IT my study journey takes me to. During my time studying at RMIT I will be learning various useful skills such as time management, professional writing, creative thinking, and problem solving, Experience in contributing to group projects and working in teams. All these skills are required for me to pursue my ideal Job of becoming an IT project manager. Through this course I will gain expertise in IT and computing, I plan to use my knowledge and gained computing expertise to improve project and process flows, investigate technical issues and make a real difference in my workplace as a team leader.

My ideal job or more I should say goal job would be to become an IT project manager. An IT Project Manager's role is to organize, plan, integrate cross-functional IT projects and make sure projects are delivered on time and on budget. The IT project manager identifies any risks associated with completing the project. It is essential to have teamwork skills in this role as all projects require different fields of IT professionals to collaborate to complete them, project managers will coordinate the work of other IT professionals and administrative staff to produce new software's or systems. This job is particularly appealing to me because of my social nature and love for working and leading teams to achieve a common goal. I have been involved in team sports and games all my life growing up and always enjoyed it. Becoming an IT project manager really allows me to highlight my leadership and team coordination skills. This position will have me working in a team setting where I can thrive and make an impact the most.

To be an IT project manager requires many different skills. Being such a team setting role and Its project manager much have the right language to communicate effectively in certain situations. An IT project manager has the role of a leader therefore must know how to get a team to work at its best. Being open to suggestions, supporting team members and giving them project management skills to leverage their own technical skill set towards meaningful goals.  Being a real-world navigator is essential for an IT project manager with propensity towards critical thinking. Question any delivery issues that can occur like power requirements. Use budget efficiently check hardware etc. is being purchased at a decent price, is there any compromise on quality for cheaper options? After delivery of a project the IT project manager must have protocols instore to establish accountability separate to the result. All these steps in completing projects require deep and strategic planning, which is the most essential skill required. A project manager must be familiar with IT platforms and methodologies in use and understand how a certain project will meet a company's needs.

The ability to write clear business case descriptions is essential in order to communicate with company management. The Project manager must be able to explain the ROI, expected KPIs and other values in simple terms. In today's day It projects can involve personnel from around the globe. Project meetings are carried out in various ways in person, video and audio chats/calls, this requires the project manager to schedule times to accommodate geographic disparity. Being able to deliver team meetings and setting out a plan and goals for the team to work towards is also essential for an IT Project managers role. Quality metrics that the delivered systems should meet should be overlooked and deeply understood by the project manager as to how the software or systems being designed will meet them. Making difficult decisions is a part of any leader's job, a Project manager should make well informed decisions. This ensures the management and technical contributors will trust the Project managers' decision making.

Though I have no current skills In the IT field besides a little coding I did in high school I have a very large skill base attained from my years of team sports and online team gaming. Some of these skills include team coordination, team communication, outlining objectives and setting plans with team members to efficiently execute them. Online games require strong verbal communication to coordinate and execute a common objective successfully and efficiently, for example. I have been playing these games since the age of 13 and have since been building my verbal coordination skills without even knowing it, this is an essential skill for a project manager. In high school like most kids, I played various Sports mostly team sports. Team sports require a high level of team coordination and communication often in high stress and real time situations, adaptability and problem solving is a key skill needed to be a functional member in a Team sport. Often conflicts arise as well in sports and dealing with them is a common practice, dealing with these situations over the years has helped develop my skills in solving conflicts between individuals in teams. This is also an essential skill a project manager must have to avoid any disruptions to workflow.

High school offers many opportunities for group work and collaboration with peers on various projects, Experience in working with groups and in teams I have acquired over years will help me in my journey to becoming an IT project manager and completing further team projects in the future. All goals require a plan to be executed, to achieve my ideal Job I will be completing my bachelor's degree in IT through RMIT University and after will be getting my graduate certificate in project management. Studying with fellow students and collaborating with them throughout my learning will further my teamwork skills and experience more specifically in IT projects rather than sports. After completing my bachelors, I intend to get a graduate position in any chosen field preferably I junior role in a project to help me gain experience in such environments, whilst studying as well to become an IT project manager. I naturally have great teamwork and leadership skills so building on these will not be a problem for myself throughout my IT career. I intend to then use my gained knowledge and experience through my studies and young professional career to improve work and project flow, identify and resolve issues promptly, manage time and risk efficiently and be a team leader that helps grow his teamwork efficiency.

# Project Idea : Facial Recognition for home security and access #

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95681362/146669651-63af5084-94db-4336-a10d-9f95183bfef4.png)


## Overview ##
Security is an ever-growing problem as criminals are becoming more resourceful in their methods where traditional systems with passcodes or passwords just do not cut it anymore. Typical problems arise in household security where people tend to lose the keys, security cards or forget the passwords to gain entry. On losing the keys the owner or users are forced to change all the locks which not only cost money but also open a window for someone to gain entry. It is time consuming and impacts other family members as well. Other new systems which require passcodes to gain entry have similar issues of people forgetting passwords thus restricting their access to home. Resetting passwords can be a time-consuming activity and costly exercise if the system is complex. 

Facial recognition software will allow users to have a stronger and stricter layer of security to gain access to their homes. This will eliminate needs for physical objects such as keycards, keys, or other devices to have access to the home. This project focuses on building face detection software which will provide users with keyless and remote entry to their house and related services using different Sofware's and hardware. This program will be constructed in such a way that it will detect and give access to the users through face detection done through camera. Software will use information stored in the pre-defined profiles as XML classifiers to detect faces in real time. These user profile classifiers can also identify various other service objects through this detection method. The facial recognition system can detect set users that are allowed access restricted files or rooms and have multiple implications. This can be useful to keep kids out of certain rooms.

## Motivation ##

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95681362/146669691-fee2ce2e-72cb-458e-95e8-61f96f9860bd.png)

Facial detection and recognition are a growing industry which have many uses specifically in different applications. It has been taking over the traditional passcode/passwords that have been used to gain access to homes and confidential data. It is so relevant that by 2024, the global facial recognition market could generate $7 billion in revenue. Facial recognition software's has been evolving and only getting better, the layer of security and accuracy provided is unmatched. By 2025 72% of hotel operators are expected to deploy facial recognition to identify and interact with guests. This technology will only become more relevant as more data is being stored online and its adoption by various industries. Some of the other key statistics have been documented by various articles below.

·	By 2023, 97% of airports will roll out facial recognition technology. (Reservations.com)

·	Between 2014 and 2018, facial recognition software became 20 times better at searching databases to find a matching photograph. (NIST)

·	According to Apple, the probability that a random person could look at someone else’s iPhone X and unlock it using Face ID is approximately 1 in 1,000,000. (Apple)

This highlights the value facial recognition will have in the future in various fields, especially in use for security. The accuracy and wide adaptability of these technologies have endless possibilities.

## Description ##

The use of facial recognition and smart security for residential protection is one of the most exciting innovations. It’s a user-friendly system using proven technology operating within the privacy of people’s homes to protect their family and belongings. The facial recognition home security system will be equipped with facial recognition to arm or disarm the main access automatically when members of the home are gone or present. If the system picks up an individual recognized as a household member, it knows there is no need to raise the alarm also and will stay neutral. This system will be able to identify unwanted guest or unauthorized users trying to gain access and can be set to raise alarms, send alerts to Houshold members, or even notify first responders as per the mechanism is set. Its wide compatibility and uses make it very appealing and adaptable to different user cases. 

The key features of a facial recognition engine are:

**Facial detection** - The first step technology takes to identify a face. This step requires the technology to scan the whole image to see if any area contains parts of human. Quick and Accurate face detection is an essential first step to ensure the successful performance of the entire facial recognition process. This software will have a lot of facial matching algorithms, using hundreds or thousands of feature detection points on a face to establish identify of the individual. 

**Face feature extraction** - The engine extracts a n-dimensional vector set (called template) from the face image. For a higher precision, a high n value is required, Once the template is extracted from the individual's face it is used for then matching. The template that has been extracted is then matched to those pre-set in a database. An individual's template is matched to the entire database to do a 1:N search in order to find the best match to confirm identity. FaceMe only stores encrypted template data, no actual images are stored through their platform ensuring privacy is fully protected.

**Facial recognition system** - Will be able to prevent unauthorized or blocked members from entering the premises by matching live images against a data base of preset identities.

**Smart locks** - Can also be integrated into the system, they work by granting access using wireless protocol and cryptographic key for authorization. Facial recognition can be embedded into smart locks if a user wants to limit certain areas of the house or certain rooms, they can give keys to authorized personnel only. The implementations of facial recognition are very vast.

## Tools and technologies ##

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95681362/146669739-869b28aa-08f5-4ea6-be74-f9f7945d9374.png)

The tools and technologies required for this project are remarkably simple and easily acquirable. 

**Software** 
Face Me is a software development kit. It can be adapted and customized into multiple devices on a network, as a software development kit Face Me can be integrated into any device or operating system. FaceMe offers one of the markets most comprehensive chipsets and OS support. The technology meets the highest accuracy and security standards for deployment across different use cases. 

**Hardware for Facial Recognition**
On hardware considerations, there is no one-size fits all approach to facial recognition. Solutions should always be customized to the end-user and their industry, as well as the specific use case’s needs and scope. There are endless hardware options capable of running facial recognition. Some of the most common include IP enabled cameras, Biometric door locks, Electronic lockpad for various access doors, PCs, workstations and smart IoT or AIoT devices. For each type of device, there are several options for chipset or camera type which can be used. This is on top of a number of other considerations, each having an impact on performance and the total cost of ownership. For details, please read Facial Recognition at the Edge – The Ultimate Guide 2021.

This Facial Recognition security system will achieve a higher and more secure level of protection for clients that want to protect their home from unauthorized individuals entering. This system will store images of people who can come and who cannot be completely customizable. For example, if you go on holiday there is no need to leave your keys or worry about someone else losing them, set the user that will be entering your home in the system database and voila you have given them keyless entry. No more sending money on replacement keys or wasting time resetting passwords, this system will allow for more accurate and secure access control. This will change the way the security system is set up in homes for the best.
